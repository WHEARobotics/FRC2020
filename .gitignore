## This file tells git to ignore certain files or folders and not try
## to add them to version control.  In this case, we don't want to 
## version control the Pycharm project files (will be different on each
## computer), nor the cache folders that the robotpy_intstaller keeps.

## Pycharm projects
.idea/

## robotpy_installer cache folders
opkg_cache/
pip_cache/
